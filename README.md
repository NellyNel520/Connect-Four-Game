###### A breif description
For this project I will recreate Connect 4, a simple board game from my childhood. It is a two player game where Both players are assigned a specific color begin with 21 identical pieces. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens
If all 42 game pieces are played and no player has places four pieces in a row, the game is drawn.
